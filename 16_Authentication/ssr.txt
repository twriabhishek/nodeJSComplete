*)Server side rendering ek concept hai jisme hum complete html and css backend s hi render karatey hai.


Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where the server generates the HTML of a web page that is requested by the client (usually a web browser). This means that the server processes the code, executes any necessary scripts, and compiles the HTML content to send back to the client's browser.

In contrast to client-side rendering (CSR), where the browser downloads a minimal HTML file and then the client-side JavaScript code executes to dynamically render the page content, SSR sends fully rendered HTML to the client from the server.

SSR has several advantages, including:

1. **Improved initial load time**: Since the server sends pre-rendered HTML, the browser can display the page content faster, especially on slower devices or connections.
2. **Better SEO**: Search engines can easily crawl and index the content since it's available in the initial HTML response.
3. **Enhanced performance on low-powered devices**: Devices with limited processing power benefit from receiving pre-rendered HTML instead of having to execute JavaScript to render the page.
4. **Accessibility**: Users with JavaScript disabled can still access the content because the server sends fully rendered HTML.

However, SSR also has some downsides, such as increased server load and complexity in managing server-side rendering for dynamic content. It's often used in conjunction with client-side rendering to achieve the benefits of both approaches, a strategy known as universal or isomorphic rendering.

1)Hum chahey then route define karney k baad uskey just nichey complete html and css return kar saktey hai.
2)Lekin yeh karney s code bahut bulky ho jata hai.
3)Isi problem ko solve karney k liye kuch template engines hotey hai like as ejs(embedded javascript template engine), pug and handlebars.
4)Yeh template engines hamarey liye ssr ki problem ko solve karety hai.
