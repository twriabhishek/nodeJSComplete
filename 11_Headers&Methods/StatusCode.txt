HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. 
Responses are grouped in five classes:

Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)

For a PUT request: HTTP 200, HTTP 204 should imply "resource updated successfully". HTTP 201 if the PUT request created a new resource.

For a DELETE request: HTTP 200 or HTTP 204 should imply "resource deleted successfully".
