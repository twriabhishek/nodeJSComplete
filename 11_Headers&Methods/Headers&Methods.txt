Suppose A aur B 2 friends hai. A, B ko letter bhejta hai. A letter ko likhta hai then usko ek envelop m pack 
kar deta hai. Aur us envelop par A, B ki information likta hai like as address, pincode, street number like that.
Ab agar hum relate karey in cheezon ko computer terminology s then hum kah saktey hai ki:

A act as client
B act as server
Meta information as a header
letter act as real data
Postman act as internet

Headers builtin and custom two types k hotey hai.
Always remember jab bhi hum custom header banaye then uskey aagey X ko append karr le.
