1)Normally yeh hota hai ki jab koi client, server ko request karta hai then usi ke sath client and server ke beech 
ek connection establish ho jata hai aur badley m server uss client ki request ka response send karta hai. Aur jab yeh request
and response cycle complete ho jati hai then connection close ho jata hai.

2)polling m basically client every second server ko poll karta hai ki hamarey liye kuch message hai ki nahi.

3)Real time applications ko polling ke through achieve kiya ja sakta hai. But polling ek right way nahi because yeh hamarey server ki
performance ko overkill kar deta hai aur server parr too much load increase ho jata hai.

4)Isliye real time application ke liye hum websocket ka use kartey hai.

5)websocket ek protocol hai jo bidirectional communication karta hai. Means ws m connection close nahi hota hai.

6)ws connection banane k liye client, server ko ek http request karta hai aur header m updrade send karta hai server is upgrade
ko dekhkar ek ws connection establish kar leta hai.

7)Upgrade
The HTTP 1.1 (only) Upgrade header can be used to upgrade an already established client/server connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol). For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP 1.1 to HTTP 2.0, or an HTTP or HTTPS connection into a WebSocket.

8)The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
